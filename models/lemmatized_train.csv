"872";"1223";"btrfs fix truncation of compressed and inlined extent when truncating a file to a smaller size which consists of an inline extent that is compressed we did not discard or made unusable the data between the new file size and the old file size wasting metadata space and allowing for the truncated data to be leaked and the data corruption loss mentioned below we were also not correctly decrementing the number of byte used by the inode we were setting it to zero giving a wrong report for caller of the stat 2 syscall the fsck tool also reported an error about a mismatch between the nbytes of the file versus the real space used by the file now because we weren t discarding the truncated region of the file it wa possible for a caller of the clone ioctl to actually read the data that wa truncated allowing for a security breach without requiring root access to the system using only standard filesystem operation the scenario is the following 1 user a creates a file which consists of an inline and compressed extent with a size of 2000 byte the file is not accessible to any other user no read write or execution permission for anyone else 2 the user truncates the file to a size of 1000 byte 3 user a make the file world readable 4 user b creates a file consisting of an inline extent of 2000 byte 5 user b issue a clone operation from user a s file into it own file using a length argument of 0 clone the whole range 6 user b now get to see the 1000 byte that user a truncated from it file before it made it file world readbale user b also lost the byte in the range 1000 2000 byte from it own file but that might be ok if his her intention wa reading stale data from user a that wa never supposed to be public note that this contrast with the case where we truncate a file from 2000 byte to 1000 byte and then truncate it back from 1000 to 2000 byte in this case reading any byte from the range 1000 2000 will return a value of 0x00 instead of the original data this problem exists since the clone ioctl wa added and happens both with and without my recent data loss and file corruption fix for the clone ioctl patch btrfs fix file corruption and data loss after cloning inline extent so fix this by truncating the compressed inline extent a we do for the non compressed case which involves decompressing if the data isn t already in the page cache compressing the truncated version of the extent writing the compressed content into the inline extent and then truncate it the following test case for fstests reproduces the problem in order for the test to pas both this fix and my previous fix for the clone ioctl that forbids cloning a smaller inline extent into a larger one which is titled btrfs fix file corruption and data loss after cloning inline extent are needed without that other fix the test fails in a different way that doe not leak the truncated data instead part of destination file get replaced with zero because the destination file ha a

512 byte while file bar consists of a single inline extent with an uncompressed size of 256 byte for our test s purpose it s important that file bar ha an inline extent with a size smaller than foo s inline extent xfs_io_prog f c pwrite s 0xa1 0 128 c pwrite s 0x2a 128 384 scratch_mnt foo _filter_xfs_io xfs_io_prog f c pwrite s 0xbb 0 256 scratch_mnt bar _filter_xfs_io now durably persist all metadata and data we do this to make sure that we get on disk an inline extent with a size of 512 byte for file foo sync now truncate our file foo to a smaller size because it consists of a compressed and inline extent btrfs did not shrink the inline extent to the new size if the extent wa not compressed btrfs would shrink it to 128 byte it only update the inode s i_size to 128 byte xfs_io_prog c truncate 128 scratch_mnt foo now clone foo s inline extent into bar this clone operation should fail with errno eopnotsupp because the source file consists only of an inline extent and the file s size is smaller than the inline extent of the destination 128 byte 256 byte however the clone ioctl wa not prepared to deal with a file that ha a size smaller than the size of it inline extent something that happens only for compressed inline extent resulting in copying the full inline extent from the source file into the destination file note that btrfs clone operation for inline extent consists of removing the inline extent from the destination inode and copy the inline extent from the source inode into the destination inode meaning that if the destination inode s inline extent is larger n byte than the source inode s inline extent m byte some byte n m byte will be lost from the destination file btrfs could copy the source inline extent s data into the destination s inline extent so that we would not lose any data but that s currently not done due to the complexity that would be needed to deal with such case specially when one or both extent are compressed returning eopnotsupp a it s normally not a very common case to clone very small file only case where we get inline extent and copying inline extent doe not save any space unlike for normal non inlined extent cloner_prog s 0 d 0 l 0 scratch_mnt foo scratch_mnt bar now because the above clone operation used to succeed and due to foo s inline extent not being shinked by the truncate operation our file bar got the whole inline extent copied from foo making u lose the last 128 byte from bar which got replaced by the byte in range 128 256 from foo before foo wa truncated in other word data loss from bar and being able to read old and stale data from foo that should not be possible to read anymore through normal filesystem operation contrast with the case where we truncate a file from a size n to a smaller size m truncate it back to size n and then read the range m n we should always get the value 0x00 for all the byte in that range we expected the clone operation to fail with errno eopnotsupp and therefore not modify our file s bar data metadata so it content should be 256 byte long with all byte having the value 0xbb without the btrfs bug fix the clone operation succeeded and resulted in leaking truncated data from foo the byte that belonged to it range 128 256 and losing data from bar in that same range so reading the file gave u the following content 0000000 a1 a1 a1 a1 a1 a1 a1 a1 a1 a1 a1 a1 a1 a1 a1 a1

called with the mmap_sem hold in read mode in those case the huge page fault can allocate hugepmds under pmd_none_or_clear_bad and that can trigger a false positive from pmd_bad that will not like to see a pmd materializing a trans huge it s not khugepaged causing the problem khugepaged hold the mmap_sem in write mode and all those site must hold the mmap_sem in read mode to prevent pagetables to go away from under them during code review it seems vm86 mode on 32bit kernel requires that too unless it s restricted to 1 thread per process or up build the race is only with the huge pagefaults that can convert a pmd_none into a pmd_trans_huge effectively all these pmd_none_or_clear_bad site running with mmap_sem in read mode are somewhat speculative with the page fault and the result is always undefined when they run simultaneously this is probably why it wasn t common to run into this for example if the madvise madv_dontneed run zap_page_range shortly before the page fault the hugepage will not be zapped if the page fault run first it will be zapped altering pmd_bad not to error out if it find hugepmds won t be enough to fix this because zap_pmd_range would then proceed to call zap_pte_range which would be incorrect if the pmd become a pmd_trans_huge the simplest way to fix this is to read the pmd in the local stack regardless of what we read no need of actual cpu barrier only compiler barrier needed and be sure it is not changing under the code that computes it value even if the real pmd is changing under the value we hold on the stack we don t care if we actually end up in zap_pte_range it mean the pmd wa not none already and it wa not huge and it can t become huge from under u khugepaged locking explained above all we need is to enforce that there is no way anymore that in a code path like below pmd_trans_huge can be false but pmd_none_or_clear_bad can run into a hugepmd the overhead of a barrier is just a compiler tweak and should not be measurable i only added it for thp build i don t exclude different compiler version may have prevented the race too by caching the value of pmd on the stack that hasn t been verified but it wouldn t be impossible considering pmd_none_or_clear_bad pmd_bad pmd_trans_huge pmd_none are all inlines and there s no external function called in between pmd_trans_huge and pmd_none_or_clear_bad if

per endpoint this one is a bit of a different kind giving a bit more background on why sctp authentication is needed can be found in rfc4895 sctp us 32 bit verification tag to protect itself against blind attacker these value are not changed during the lifetime of an sctp association looking at new sctp extension there is the need to have a method of proving that an sctp chunk s wa really sent by the original peer that started the association and not by a malicious attacker to cause this bug we re triggering an init collision between peer normal sctp handshake where both side intent to authenticate packet contains random chunk hmac algo parameter that are being negotiated among peer init random chunk hmac algo init ack random chunk hmac algo cookie echo cookie ack rfc4895 say that each endpoint therefore know it own random number and the peer s random number after the association ha been established the local and peer s random number along with the shared key are then part of the secret used for calculating the hmac in the auth chunk now in our scenario we have 2 thread with 1 non blocking seq_packet socket each setting up common shared sctp_auth_key and sctp_auth_active_key properly and each of them calling sctp_bindx 3 listen 2 and connect 2 against each other thus the handshake look similar to this e g init random chunk hmac algo init ack random chunk hmac algo init random chunk hmac algo init ack random chunk hmac algo since such collision can also happen with verification tag the rfc4895 for auth rather vaguely say under section 6 1 in case of init collision the rule governing the handling of this random number follow the same pattern a those for the verification tag a explained in section 5 2 4 of rfc 2960 5 therefore each endpoint know it own random number and the peer s random number after the association ha been established in rfc2960 section 5 2 4 we re eventually hitting action b b in this case both side may be attempting to start an association at about the same time but the peer endpoint started it init after responding to the local endpoint s init thus it may have picked a new verification tag not being aware of the previous tag it had sent this endpoint the endpoint should stay in or enter the established state but it must update it peer s verification tag from the state cookie stop any init or cookie timer that may running and send a cookie ack in other word the handling of the random parameter is the same a behavior for the verification tag a described in action b of section 5 2 4 looking at the code we exactly hit the sctp_sf_do_dupcook_b case which trigger an sctp_cmd_update_assoc command to the side effect interpreter and in fact it properly copy over peer_ random hmacs chunk parameter from the newly created association to update the existing one also the old asoc_shared_key is being released and based on the new params sctp_auth_asoc_init_active_key updated however the issue observed in this case is that the previous asoc peer auth_capable wa 0 and ha not been updated so that instead of creating a new secret we re doing an early return from the function sctp_auth_asoc_init_active_key leaving asoc asoc_shared_key a null however we now have to authenticate chunk from the updated chunk list e g cookie ack that in fact cause the server side when responding with auth cookie ack to trigger a null pointer dereference since in sctp_packet_transmit it discovers that an auth chunk is being queued for xmit and thus it call sctp_auth_calculate_hmac since the asoc active_key_id is still inherited from the endpoint and the same a encoded into the chunk it us asoc asoc_shared_key which is still null a an asoc_key and dereferences it in crypto_hash_setkey desc tfm asoc_key data 0 asoc_key len causing an oops all this happens because sctp_make_cookie_ack called with the new association ha the peer auth_capable 1 and therefore mark the chunk with auth 1 after checking sctp_auth_send_cid but it is actually sent later on over the then updated association s transport that didn t initialize it shared key due to peer auth_capable 0 since control chunk in that case are not sent by the temporary association which are scheduled for deletion they are issued for xmit via sctp_cmd_reply in the interpreter with the context of the updated association peer auth_capable wa 0 in the updated association which went from cookie_wait into established state since all previous processing that performed sctp_process_init wa being done on temporary association that we eventually throw away each time the correct fix is to update to the new peer auth_capable value a well in the collision case via sctp_assoc_update so that in case the collision migrated from 0 1 sctp_auth_asoc_init_active_key can properly recalculate the secret this therefore fix the observed server panic fix 730fc3d05cd4 sctp implete sctp auth parameter processing reported by jason gunthorpe

"6575";"823";"bpf prevent out of bound speculation on pointer arithmetic jann reported that the original commit back in b2157399cc98 bpf prevent out of bound speculation wa not sufficient to stop cpu from speculating out of bound memory access while b2157399cc98 only focussed on masking array map access for unprivileged user for tail call and data access such that the user provided index get sanitized from bpf program and syscall side there is still a more generic form affected from bpf program that applies to most map that hold user data in relation to dynamic map access when dealing with unknown scalar or slow known scalar a access offset for example load a map value pointer into r6 load an index into r7 do a slow computation e g with a memory dependency that load a limit into r8 e g load the limit from a map for high latency then mask it to make the verifier happy exit if r7 r8 mispredicted branch load r0 r6 r7 load r0 r6 r0 for unknown scalar there are two option in the bpf verifier where we could derive knowledge from in order to guarantee safe access to the memory i while variant won t allow to derive any lower or upper bound from the unknown scalar where it would be safe to add it to the map value pointer it is possible through test however ii another option is to transform the unknown scalar into a known scalar for example through alu ops combination such a r imm followed by r imm or any similar combination where the original information from the unknown scalar would be destroyed entirely leaving r with a constant the initial slow load still precedes the latter alu ops on that register so the cpu executes speculatively from that point once we have the known scalar any compare operation would work then a third option only involving register with known scalar could be crafted a described in 0 where a cpu port e g slow int unit would be filled with many dependent computation such that the subsequent condition depending on it outcome ha to wait for evaluation on it execution port and thereby executing speculatively if the speculated code can be scheduled on a different execution port or any other form of mistraining a described in 1 for example given this is not limited to only unknown scalar not only map but also stack access is affected since both is accessible for unprivileged user and could potentially be used for out of bound access under speculation in order to prevent any of these case the verifier is now sanitizing pointer arithmetic on the offset such that any out of bound speculation would be masked in a way where the pointer arithmetic result in the destination register will stay unchanged meaning offset masked into zero similar a in array_index_nospec case with regard to implementation there are three option that were considered i new insn for sanitation ii push pop insn and sanitation a inlined bpf iii reuse of ax register and sanitation a inlined bpf option i ha the downside that we end up using from reserved bit in the opcode space but also that we would require each jit to emit masking a native arch opcodes meaning mitigation would have slow adoption till everyone implement it eventually which is counter productive option ii and iii have both in common that a temporary register is needed in order to implement the sanitation a inlined bpf since we are not allowed to modify the source register while a push pop insn in ii would be useful to have in any case it requires once again that every jit need to implement it first while possible amount of change needed would also be unsuitable for a stable patch therefore the path which ha fewer change le bpf instruction for the mitigation and doe not require anything to be changed in the jits is option iii which this work is pursuing the ax register is already mapped to a register in all jits modulo arm32 where it s mapped to stack a various other bpf register there and used in constant blinding for jits only so far it can be reused for verifier rewrite under certain constraint the interpreter s tmp register ha therefore been remapped into extending the register set with hidden ax register and reusing that for a number of instruction that needed the prior temporary variable internally e g div mod this allows for zero increase in stack space usage in the interpreter and enables restricted generic use in rewrite otherwise a long a such a patchlet doe not make use of these instruction the sanitation mask is dynamic and relative to the offset the map value or stack pointer currently hold there are various case that need to be taken under consideration for the masking e g such operation could look a follows ptr val or val ptr or ptr val thus the value to be sanitized could reside either in source or in destination register and the limit is different depending on whether the alu op is addition or subtraction and depending on the current known and bounded offset the limit is derived a follows limit max_value_size smin_value off for subtraction limit umax_value off this hold because we do not allow any pointer arithmetic that would temporarily go out of bound or would have an unknown value with mixed signed bound where it is unclear at verification time whether the actual runtime value would be either negative or positive for example we have a derived map pointer value with constant offset and bounded one so limit based on smin_value work because the verifier requires that statically analyzed arithmetic on the pointer must be in bound and thus it check if resulting smin_value off and umax_value off is still within map value bound at time of arithmetic in addition to time of access similarly for the case of stack access we derive the limit a follows max_bpf_stack off for subtraction and off for the case of addition where off ptr_reg off ptr_reg var_off value subtraction is a special case for the masking which can be in form of ptr val ptr val or ptr val in the first two case where we know that the value is negative we need to temporarily negate the value in order to do the sanitation on a positive value where we later swap the alu op and restore original source register if the value wa in source the sanitation of pointer arithmetic alone is still not fully sufficient a is since a scenario like the following could happen ptr 0x1000 e g k based imm ptr big_number_with_slow_comparison ptr 0x1000 ptr big_number_with_slow_comparison which under speculation could end up a ptr 0x1000 ptr 0 truncated by mitigation ptr 0x1000 ptr 0 truncated by mitigation and therefore still access out of bound to prevent such case the verifier is also analyzing safety for potential out of bound access under speculative execution meaning it is also simulating pointer access under truncation we therefore branch off and push the current verification state after the alu operation with known 0 to the verification stack for later analysis given the current path analysis succeeded it is likely that the one under speculation can be pruned in any case it is also subject to existing complexity limit and therefore anything beyond this point will be rejected in term of pruning it need to be ensured that the verification state from speculative execution simulation must never prune a non speculative execution path therefore we mark verifier state accordingly at the time of push_stack if verifier detects out of bound access under speculative execution from one of the possible path that includes a truncation it will reject such program given we mask every reg based pointer arithmetic for unprivileged program we ve been looking into how it could affect real world program in term of size increase a the majority of program are targeted for privileged only use case we ve unconditionally enabled masking with it alu restriction on top of it for privileged program for the sake of testing in order to check i whether they get rejected in it current form and ii by how much the number of instruction and size will increase we ve tested this by using katran cilium and test_l4lb from the kernel selftests for katran we ve evaluated balancer_kern o cilium bpf_lxc o and an older test object bpf_lxc_opt_ dunknown o and l4lb we ve used test_l4lb o a well a test_l4lb_noinline o we found that none of the program got rejected by the verifier with this change and that impact is rather minimal to none balancer_kern o had 13 904 byte 1 738 insns xlated and 7 797 byte jited before and after the change most complex program in bpf_lxc o had 30 544 byte 3 817 insns xlated and 18 538 byte jited before and after and none of the other tail call program in bpf_lxc o had any change either for the older bpf_lxc_opt_ dunknown o object we found a small increase from 20 616 byte 2 576 insns and 12 536 byte jited before to 20 664 byte 2 582 insns and 12 558 byte jited after the change other program from that object file had similar small increase both test_l4lb o had no change and remained at 6 544 byte 817 insns xlated and 3 401 byte jited and for test_l4lb_noinline o constant at 5 080 byte 634 insns xlated and 3 313 byte jited this can be explained in that llvm typically optimizes stack based pointer arithmetic by using k based operation and that use of dynamic map access is not overly frequent however in future we may decide to optimize the algorithm further under known guarantee from branch and value speculation latter seems also unclear in term of prediction heuristic that today s cpu apply a well a whether there could be collision in e g the predictor s value history pattern table for triggering out of bound access thus masking is performed unconditionally at this point but could be subject to relaxation later on we were generally also brainstorming various other approach for mitigation but the blocker wa always lack of available register at runtime and or overhead for runtime tracking of limit belonging to a specific pointer thus we found this to be minimally intrusive under given constraint with that in place a simple example with sanitized access on unprivileged load at post verification time look a
